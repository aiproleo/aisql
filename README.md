# Overview

### Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs
Niklaus Wirth's famous formula, "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs," has long been a cornerstone in computer science education. This formula leads to the logical conclusion that "Operation + SQL = Enterprise Applications." ERP, CRM, EPM, and other similar systems fundamentally revolve around the manipulation and management of data. They essentially involve techniques to split, combine, and query data from various data sources. In other words, the main backbone is to execute SQL operations on databases. In another word, SQL.
Understanding this core principle sheds light on a revolutionary thought: What if advanced AI, like ChatGPT, could handle SQL with remarkable proficiency? Could it redefine the landscape of enterprise applications?

Niklaus Wirth's formula, "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs," remains relevant, but its application has evolved. In the realm of enterprise applications, the combination of operations and SQL forms the foundation of systems like ERP, CRM, and EPM. However, the rise of AI, exemplified by ChatGPT's capabilities, challenges the traditional approach to these systems. By automating and optimizing SQL queries, AI has the potential to transform how businesses manage and utilize their data, potentially reducing the need for costly enterprise software. This shift underscores the ongoing evolution in the intersection of technology and business, driven by advancements in AI and data processing.

Imagine a scenario where a business user can ask ChatGPT to generate a SQL query to find correlations between seemingly unrelated data points, such as sales data for beer and socks. The AI can generate a precise query, providing insights that would typically require specialized knowledge of the database and SQL.
Niklaus Wirth's DSA formula highlights the fundamental role of SQL in enterprise applications. With the advent of AI technologies like ChatGPT, the landscape of these applications is poised for transformation. While traditional ERP and CRM systems will continue to play a vital role, integrating AI could usher in a new era of more agile, flexible, and intelligent enterprise applications.

The question is no longer whether AI will impact enterprise applications, but how businesses will adapt to and embrace this change to stay competitive in the evolving digital landscape.
This is why the prototype of this AI SQL Linguist app is important.
